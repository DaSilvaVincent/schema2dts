[//]: # (::contents:start)

It is intended to support JSONSchema7/OpenAPI3 but may work for some if not most
JSONSchema versions.

This module assumes your JSONSchema / OpenAPI3 documents are valid. It also
doesn't support external references at the moment and expect a single object
whose definitions are all relative to the root object.

It is also meant to be a building block for higher level generators.

## Usage

```ts
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync } from 'fs';
import {
  generateJSONSchemaTypes,
  generateOpenAPITypes,
  toSource,
} from 'schema2dts';

// Open API
const openAPISchema = JSON.parse(readFileSync('openapi.json').toString());

writeFileSync('API.d.ts', toSource(await generateOpenAPITypes(openAPISchema)));

// JSON Schema
const jsonSchema = JSON.parse(readFileSync('schema.json').toString());

writeFileSync('API.d.ts', toSource(await generateJSONSchemaTypes(jsonSchema)));
```

If you find some case with unexpected results, please add the fixtures to this
repository in a pull request and describe the problem you encounter.

## Options

You can change the API main namespace in order to be able to use several
generated types in the same repository. Just provide its namespace a the second
argument to `generateOpenAPITypes`.

The third argument is for options:

- you can generate the unused schemas (especially useful when in development
  mode) to be able to use them in your code despite the fact they ain't used in
  you API at that moment. Just set `generateUnusedSchemas` to `true`.
- you can also filter the statuses you wish to generate by setting
  `filterStatuses` to `[200, 201, 202, 300]` for example so that the 500 errors
  responses ain't taken in count.

## Known issues

There is some differences between the JSONSchema `anyOf`, `allOf` and `oneOf`
keywords (learn
[more here on combining schemas](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/combining.html)).

The current way to handle this in this library is to:

- convert `oneOf` to a
  [union type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html#union-types)
  which is valid
- convert `anyOf` to a union type too which is not really what it means in JSON
  Schema
- convert `allOf` to an
  [intersection type](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/unions-and-intersections.html#intersection-types)
  which is completly wrong and will work only with JSON Schemas meant to be used
  that way. By example, combining and existing object schema with another object
  to make some properties required won't work at all (eg
  `{ "allOf": [{ "$ref": "#/definitions/User"}, { "required": ["id"] }]}`).

We will update this behavior as soon as we can.
